```

## R Markdown

Fitted distribution is \[WEIB(\eta = `r params["scale"]`, \beta = `r params$shape`)\] using this we can simulate \[`r params$units`\] failure

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
