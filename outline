Reliability Basics

Understand Reliability
 Reliability - Maintainability - Availability
 MTTF vs MTBF (nonrepairable vs repairable items)

Understanding Reliability Data
 Data structures for nonrepairable systems
 Data structures for repairable systems
 Censored observations (right, left, and interval censored)
 Introduce explanatory variables (e.g. covariates, features)

Fitting models to Reliability Data
  nonparametric reliability estimates (Kaplan-Meijer estimator, Nelson-Aalen estimator)
  Probability Distribtions (Weibull, exponential, lognormal)
  Distribution functions (PDF, CDF, survival, hazard, cumulative hazard, quantile)
  Graphical methods for fitting distributions to reliability data (weibull plots, exponential plots, lognormal plots)
  Likelihood based methods for fitting distributions to reliability data

Assessing uncertainty
  Confidence intervals based on the normal distribution
  Likelihood based confidence intervals
  bootstrap based confidence intervals

Understanding and documenting your model assumptions
